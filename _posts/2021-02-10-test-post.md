So, how does it work out, writing posts as .md files, and _publishing_ via Git.. 

I guess one thing I need to work on, is a way of having a template .md file to add in the standard requirements, e.g. 

```
---
layout: default
title:
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

That would be quite handy.  And decide on my workflow process;

- do I want/need a branch for each post? 

I'm also not really sure about having the blog powered by a public repo either.

Things to think about then;

- [ ] template for _posts folder .md files
- [ ] workflow; branch for each entry?
- [ ] stick with public repo? 

Until next time...
